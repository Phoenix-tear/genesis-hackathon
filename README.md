# Metamask Login Page

In this project, we have created a simple login page using metamask signing function using jwt authentication. This code implements the frontend in vanilla JS and backend in Express JS. It uses the ethers.js API library for performing the fetch function of the Cryptocurrency Data.

To run the code, you need to run the following commands. 

```shell
npm install 
```

Then start the backend server by using the following command 

```shell
node home.js
```

and go to http://localhost:3000, connect the Metamask and test the application.
